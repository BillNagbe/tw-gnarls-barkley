                <h3>A brilliant Name</h3>
                <p>The band name Gnarls Barkley, was created while Danger Mouse was playinga a name of fake celebrity names. When he said the name out load he knew it was a right and wrote it down on a piece of paper. The band name has nothing to do with the basketball player Charles Barkley.</p>
